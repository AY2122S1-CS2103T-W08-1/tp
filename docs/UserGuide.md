## Overview <br>
Notor is a desktop application for mentors to keep tabs on their mentees, **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type faster than the average typing speed, Notor allows you to take notes quickly and efficiently during meetings with mentees, and group those notes with your mentee's information powerfully and easily.

Key features of Notor are:

* Powerful Organisation which is up to the user to manage many mentees
  * Group mentees, and place groups into subgroups for greater control
  * Add tags to mentees and sort by tags to easily identify meta-data about your contacts
  * Archive contacts you’re no longer actively mentoring, but keep them in your Notor to retrieve at any time
* Clean note-taking system
  * Take notes concurrently with meeting the mentee through no-frills text files
  * Drop time stamps whenever you update your information and meet with the mentee effortlessly
* Fast CLI
  * Commands with short forms
  * Works offline for better performance

## Command Breakdown
Here is a detailed breakdown of all the commands Notor has available. All the commands have a shortened command format, referred to interchangeably as 'advanced format' and 'short format'.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `person /create n:NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `/create n:John Doe`.
* Round brackets `()` refer to COMPULSORY arguments.<br>
  e.g. `g:(GROUP_NAME)` means that the group name must be entered at that position.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n:NAME [g:GROUP_NAME]` can be used as `n:Elton g:Orbital` or as `n:Elton`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, with a comma separating terms.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG…​]` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t:tag1, tag2, tag3` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `g:GROUP_NAME sg:SUBGROUP_NAME`, `sg:SUBGROUP_NAME g:GROUP_NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p:12341234 p:56785678`, only `p:56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Archiving People
Archiving people allows you to only view the contacts you are actively managing, while still keeping the information
of older mentees within Notor. You might also want to view the [Export](#exporting-data) command. You can restore
archived mentees at any time.

#### _Archiving a person_

Format: `person (INDEX) /archive` <br>
Advanced user Format: `p (INDEX) /ar`

</div>

<a name = "group-command"></a>

### Working with groups/subgroups
You can also create a group to organize people based on their common traits. In addition to groups, you can also create a subgroup
of a group to organize people based on a more specific category. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
You can sort your contacts in Notor by the group that they are in, as well as taking general notes on the group. A few ideas on how you can use groups are:

* Group people you tend to talk to together. When meeting them, you can sort your Notor by that group, so that you can reference just their contacts
* Group mentees with common interests. This makes it convenient if you want to reach out to all mentees with a certain shared interest
* Group mentees who you need to achieve certain checkpoints with. For example, if in your job as a mentor you must find out from every mentee a certain list of goals, you can put this checklist into Notor as a group note, then reference it as you contact each mentee.

</div>

#### _Creating a group_

Creates a group.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
Creating a group command works no matter what list is in the List Pane. **However, the rest of group commands below will work only when groups or subgroups are listed.**
</div> <br>

Format: `group (GROUP_NAME) /create`<br>
Advanced user Format: `g (GROUP_NAME) /c`

Advanced user Format: `g (INDEX) /d`

Examples :

* `group 1 /delete` will delete the group at index 1.
* `g 1 /d`

#### _Creating a subgroup_

Creates a new subgroup.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
This command only works when groups are listed in the list pane, and not when subgroups are listed. In other words, a subgroup cannot have subgroups.
</div> <br>

Format: `group (INDEX) /create n:SUBGROUP_NAME`<br>
Advanced user Format: `g (INDEX) /c n:SUBGROUP_NAME`

* Creates a new subgroup of group at the index specified with the name `SUBGROUP_NAME`.
* The new subgroup must not have the same name as other existing subgroups in the same group.
* The new subgroup's name must not include any backslash (`/`) or underscore (`_`).

Examples :

* `group 1 /create n:Artemis` will create a new subgroup Artemis in group at index 1.
* `g 1 /create n:Artemis`

* Pops up a note window to add note to group or subgroup.

Format: `group (INDEX) /note`<br>
Advanced user Format: `group (INDEX) /n`

## Filtering with Notor

Sometimes, you will want to view all people, groups, subgroups to understand what you have saved in your Notor. At other times, you will want to find those which fit into certain parameters. Here are the ways to view a subset of your data.

### List

List can show all persons, groups, subgroups which you have added to Notor.
It can also list archived persons: see [Archiving People](#archiving-people).

#### _Listing all persons_

Lists all persons in the list panel.

Format: `person /list`<br>
Advanced user Format:`p /l`
![personList](images/personList.png)

#### _Listing all groups_

Lists all groups in the list panel.

Format:  `group /list`<br>
Advanced user Format: `g /l`
![groupList](images/groupList.png)

#### _Listing all persons in a group or subgroup_

Lists all persons in that group or subgroup.<br>

Format: `person (INDEX) /list`<br>
Advanced user Format:`p (INDEX) /l`

* Only works if you have listed out all groups or subgroups in Notor.
* Lists all persons of a group or subgroup that is at the given `INDEX` .
* Do not confuse this with the list all subgroups command, whose first command word is `group`

Examples:

* `person 1 /list`
* `p 2 /l`

#### _Listing all subgroups in a group_

Lists all the subgroups within a group.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
Do not confuse this with the list all persons command, whose first command word is <code>person</code>.
</div> <br>

* Only works if you have listed out all groups or subgroups in Notor.
* Do not confuse this with the list all persons command, whose first command word is `person`

Format: `group (INDEX) /list`<br>
Advanced user Format: `g (INDEX) /l`

Examples:

* `group 3 /list`
* `g 2 /l`

#### _Listing Archived Persons_
Shows the list of archived Persons.

Format: `person /listarchive` <br>
Advanced user Format: `p /lar`

![archivedList](images/archivePersonList.png)

### Find

Find allows you to obtain the results that match with the keyword specified. You can filter in this way on people, groups, and subgroups. In addition, you may add additional parameters to your search, in order to narrow the search further.

#### _Finding persons_

Finds all persons that match your search term. You may search for substrings within a persons name, or for tags the user must be tagged with. If you specify multiple search terms, only those people which match ALL criteria will be returned.

Format: `person  /find [n:NAME_QUERY] [t:TAG1, TAG2...]`<br>
Advanced user Format:`p /f [n:NAME_QUERY] [t:TAG1, TAG2...]`

* Finds all persons that match with given `NAME_QUERY`, or are tagged with the tags specified.
* The query for the name will match if the string exists within the name, regardless of case: `jo` will match `John` and `joanne`.
* Tags must be spelled exactly. You may specify more than one tag
* While the parameters have been marked optional, you must specify at least one of the parameters if you want to filter the results.

Examples:

* `person /find n:Alex t:graduated, engineering`
* `p /f n:Mary`
* `p /find n:Jo t:Final Year Project`

![personFind](images/personFind.png)

#### _Finding groups or subgroups_

Finds all the groups with the keyword specified. This will search for the keyword within the group's name.
Use after you have listed out all groups or subgroups.

Format:  `group /find n:QUERY_NAME`<br>
Advanced user Format: `g /f n:QUERY_NAME`

* Finds all the groups that match the `KEYWORD`.
* The keyword must not include any backslash (`/`) or underscore (`_`).
* Substrings will match: `art` will match `Art Jammers`, `Smart cookie`, and `Artemis`

Examples of finding group:

* `group /find n:Artemis`
* `g /f n:GroupA`
* `group /f n:Test`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Notor home folder.

## What's next!

In the future, we would like to implement these features to enhance the experiences of mentors in using Notor:
  * View command for the viewing pane to support viewing other types of notes and command summary through the help command.
  * Different UI settings for the users to choose the color scheme they prefer.
  * Expand help window to improve user's experience in looking for help.
  * Import command to support importing data from CSV into Notor.
  * Tagging for groups.
  * And...more! Feel free to contact the team and share your suggestions at e0588244@u.nus.edu .
