## **Acknowledgements**

This project is a further iteration of the [_AddressBook-Level 3 (
AB-3)_](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) project. All features we have are in addition to
those already present in AB-3. Removed features are listed as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

The **Architecture** of our iteration is built upon AB-3. Please refer to the AB-3 **Architecture**
section for the general Architectural design of the app. Only changes will be listed here.

### Model Changes

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Person` does not contain the `Address` field anymore.
* `Person` contains a new `Note` field.
* This UML diagram is the current class structure implemented.

Here is the better class structure to be implemented:
![ModelClassDiagram2](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Trie` allows tags to be autocompleted as commands are entered.
* Storing `String` objects in a `Trie` in AddressBook allows all tags to only get created once instead of once per
  object.
* Storing tags as `String` objects in a trie is simpler than a dedicated `Tag` class.

### Storage component

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* now includes a new `Archive` Storage component
* `Archive` allows users to temporarily remove `Person`s from their Address Book

### Common classes

**
API** : [`Trie.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/trie/Trie.java)

* Allows grouping and autocompletion of `Tag` and `Command` objects.
* Supports addition and deletion of items.
* Supports finding of first item.
* Supports finding of first item that contains specified keyword.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified
otherwise)

**Use case: Add a note**

**MSS**

1. User requests to add a note to the person
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to add a note to a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook opens up a pop up dialogue for the user to type the note for the person
5. User requests to save the note to the person
6. AddressBook stores the book to the person
7. AddressBook saves the note to storage

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.
  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.
    * 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.
      Use case resumes at step 2.

**Use case: User types a command**

**MSS**

1. User starts typing a command in AddressBook
2. AddressBook shows possible commands starting with what user has typed
3. User presses tab to select the right command
4. User presses enter to execute the selected command
5. AddressBook <u>runs command (UC1)</u>

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The typed string is not in any command.
    * 2a1. AddressBook displays no commands. Use case resumes at step 1.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
