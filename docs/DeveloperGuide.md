## **Introduction**

Thank you for your interest in the development of Notor! This is an open-source project aimed at helping mentors take
quick, efficient notes to facilitate effective and efficient mentoring of many mentees. The design principles
scaffolding Notor are as follows.

1. **Efficient UX for the User:**
    - You shouldn't have to wait for Notor; it should simply run -- quickly and without hassle.
    - Look for how you can make the process faster, more streamlined, or more effective for our clients: mentors.
2. **CLI-first**
    - We target fast-typers who are comfortable taking notes on their computer.

In particular, we tackle the needs of mentor professors, who tend to be busy and are assigned mentees they are unlikely
to personally know or run into often. A personal CRM like Notor is a useful tool to help mantain the mentor-mentee relationship. Key features of Notor which scaffold this
are:

1. Powerful Organisation which is up to the user to manage many mentees
    - Group mentees, and place groups into subgroups for greater control
    - Add tags to mentees and sort by tags to easily identify meta-data
    - Archive contacts you're no longer speaking to
2. A clean note-taking system
    - designed so that they can take notes concurrently with meeting the mentee so no information is forgotten

### Acknowledgements

This project is a further iteration of the [_AddressBook-Level 3 (
AB-3)_](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) project. All features we have are in addition to
those already present in AB-3. Removed features may or may not be listed as well.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Glossary**

* **Command structure**: The order in which parameters and command words must be written in order for the command to be
  correctly parsed
* **Dummy data**: Sample data used in testing or example data present on first launch of application
* **Group**: A container containing `Person` objects with shared traits that is created by the user
* **Key power features**: Essential features that will be used often when running the software application
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Metadata**: Personal data about a `Person` object
* **Note**: A general description of each `Person` to record their activities, with last edit timestamp attached
* **Supergroup**: SuperGroup is a group that can have many subgroups. We often use it interchangeably with `Group` as 
    `Supergroup` is more of an implementation detail.
* **Subgroup**: A child of a `Supergroup` used to store multiple persons based on a more specific category than `Supergroup`. A **
  Subgroup** can be created by specifying the parent group of the **Subgroup**. A person can be in the **Subgroup** only if 
  the person is already in the parent `Supergroup`.
* **Tag**: A string descriptor attached to `Group` objects or `Person` objects
* **Ungrouped**: Used to describe a `Person` object with no grouping

## **Design**

### Architecture

The **Architecture** of our iteration is built upon AB-3. Please refer to the AB-3 **Architecture**
section for the general Architectural design of the app. Only changes will be listed here.

### Logic Changes

#### Command Changes

![CommandClassDiagram](images/ParserClasses.png)

Due to the addition of many new commands and refactoring of the command structure, we have amended the classes related
to managing commands.

* `Parser` now takes in generic `T extends Command` since we have multiple types of commands, each with their own unique
  parser
* `Executor` instances are created by each `Command` class, which then handle the actual execution of commands and
  returning of `CommandResult`
* Commands now come in 3 general types, `PersonCommand`, `GroupCommand` and `Command`
    * `PersonCommand` operates on `Person` objects
    * `GroupCommand` operates on `Group` objects
    * `Command` operates without either a `Person` or `Group` object
* `Parser` and `Executor` classes come in the same 3 categories as `Command` classes
* `NotorParser` now parses both the `commandWord` and `subCommandWord` for user commands
    * `commandWord` refers to either `Person`, `Group` or one of the object agnostic commands
    * `subCommandWord` refers to an operation that can be carried out on a `Person` or `Group`, such as `find` or `tag`

New Workflow for Adding Commands:

1. Create a `XYZCommand` class that extends either `PersonCommand`, `GroupCommand` or simply `implements Command`.
2. Create a `XYZCommandParser` class that extends the same type of `Parser` as the `Command` above is.
3. Add the new `XYZCommandParser` to the `parse()` method in `NotorParser`.
4. Create a `XYZCommandExecutor` class that extends the same type of `Executor` as the `Command` from step 1.
5. Implement all required methods and ensure all fields used by the methods are present.


#### In-depth example of Command workflow, using the Find Command

Notor allows you to search for groups and people, and both searches have slightly different requirements.

Let's break down what happens when you call a command, like the find command. The following is a low-level sequence diagram to show in detail how the method is called.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

* The common logic for all commands is shared in `LogicManager` and `NotorParser`, which uses the Command design pattern. Making use of polymorphism, we know we will have a `Command` returned which can be executed by the `LogicManager`, while different classes hold the functionality.
* Each specific command parser (`FindCommandParser` in the diagram) is responsible for checking that the correct parameters have been passed, and forming them into the appropriate parameters. The parser creates an appropriate command (`FindPersonCommand`), which extends the `Command` interface. Hence, we know the `FindPersonCommand` will definitely implement `execute`.
* In the constructor for the `FindPersonCommand`, the `FindPersonExecutor` is initialised. As mentioned earlier, executors hold all the execution functionality. In the case of find, this means in its initialisation it is passed the predicate initialised in the `FindCommandParser` which is used to filter the list of persons in the model later
* After the initialisation of the `FindPersonCommand` is done, the Command is returned all the way to `LogicManager`.
* `LogicManager` uses the Command API to call execute() on the command, which calls the execute method on the executor.
* The executor updates the model and returns the command result, which is passed back to the `LogicManager`.


#### In-depth example of Command Workflow, using the Person Note Command.

Notor allows you to add note to a itself, a person or group in a list.

The following sequence diagram shows the detail when `PersonNoteCommand` is executed to add note for a person.

### UI Changes

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

* `MainWindow` does not contain PersonListPanel anymore.
Now it contains ListPanel which can be a PersonListPanel, GroupListPanel or SubgroupListPanel.
* `MainWindow` contains a new GeneralNote which displays the general note.


### Model Changes

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/Notor-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Person` does not contain the `Address` field anymore.
* `Person` contains a new `Note` field.
* `Person` contains `HashSet<String>` containing `SuperGroup` and `SubGroup` names for display purposes.
    * These are just `String` objects, and are not actual references to `Group` objects.
* `Name` must start with an alphabet character.
    * This is due to the fact that our parser will be unable to differentiate between indexes and names when parsing
      commands.
* `Name` may contain `-` and `.` characters.
    * This is to account for people with these special characters in their names.

Here is the better class structure to be implemented:
![ModelClassDiagram2](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

* `Trie` allows tags to be autocompleted as commands are entered.
* Storing `String` objects in a `Trie` in Notor allows all tags to only get created once instead of once per object.
* Storing tags as `String` objects in a trie is simpler than a dedicated `Tag` class.
* This feature is planned for a future update, as the `Trie` data structure has already been implemented.
* This feature could also not be implemented due to short form commands already being very user friendly.

### Storage component

*(placeholder API for now, will update to our own link later when implemented.)*

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/Notor-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* now includes a new `Archive` Storage component
* `Archive` allows users to temporarily remove `Person`s from Notor

### Common classes

**
API** : [`Trie.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/trie/Trie.java)

* Allows grouping and autocompletion of `Tag` and `Command` objects.
* Supports addition and deletion of items.
* Supports finding of first item.
* Supports finding of first item that starts with specified keyword.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: mentor professors

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has groups of contacts that have different needs

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Installing a new update shall not in any way, modify or erase existing data and value from the previous version, and
   the new update should be compatible with the data produced earlier within the system.
5. Should be able to store notes in English language. Note that support for other languages is not in scope.
6. The system should be able to handle notes with at most 1000 lines without any noticeable decrease in performance, so
   that users can keep extensive notes on their mentees.
7. The user should not lose any data if exit command is triggered by the user.
8. The system should be able to reply to the prompt or command from the user within 3 seconds.
9. The system should be logical to use for a mentor professor.
10. Should ensure personal data privacy and security of data access.
11. While the software should be accessible for colour-blind or vision impaired mentors, this goal is out of scope for Notor 1.4 due to time constraints.

1. _{ more test cases ... }_


## **Appendix: Effort**

### Tagging
AB3 supports tagging, but the tags are too restrictive as you cannot add tags cumulative.
We thought that users should be able to add tags without removing the existing tags.
So we had to change most of the implementation of tags, and add in new commands to support adding of tags of
cumulatively.

### Note taking for Person, Group and Subgroup
Notor is designed to allow mentors to be able to take note easily.
AB3 does not have this feature, so we had to implement this feature from scratch.
It was challenging to design a note window that is responsive to change.
Moreover, having a separate note window makes it more GUI based.
To optimize for mentors who type fast, we implemented keyboard shortcuts to ensure that mentors will be able to take note quickly.

### List Views
We decided to have groups and subgroups so that users can organize people in the list.
AB3 only has support listing of people. Our team needed to create new UI elements to support that.
Even when the new UI elements, it was still tough to create commands to support the operation of switching between views and
updating the list view when a change has been made.


### GUI Test (Implemented but scrapped due to CI failure)

We have initially decided to implement **GUI Testing** because many of our functionalities
such as clearing notes, tags and Notor, and adding notes uses a pop up window.

The difficulty level of GUI Testing is moderate because there is very limited
guides available on **TestFX** Library. Despite our best efforts to try to fix CI failure and the GUI testcases passing locally,
all efforts are of no avail.
