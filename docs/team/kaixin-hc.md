### Project: Notor

Notor aims to help mentors who wish to informally keep tabs on their mentees, by providing a quick way to take notes and
mantain records on their mentees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is
written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
* **Project management**:
  * Managed Project Releases 1.1-1.4 (6 milestones & releases)
  * Managed Issue Tracker throughout the project
  * Took minutes for team-meetings
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Find Person Command: ([#140](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/140)).
    * Enhanced the Find command so that it could search via tags or via name of the person, as well as search for partial strings.
    * This is useful because the user no longer needs to remember the exact name, and can use tags to further filter the list of persons
  * Tag Command: ([#133](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/133), [#121](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/121))
    * Amended the tag command so that tags are added cumulatively, rather than deleting all tags and redoing them every time
    * In Notor, this takes the form of the Tag command, the Untag Command, and the Clear Tags command
  * Refactored AB3 to Notor throughout the project ([#93](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/93))
    * While not visible to the user, this helped to clean up our code base for all of us.
  * QA for error messages in Notor ([PENDING]())
